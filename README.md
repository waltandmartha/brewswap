# BREWSWAP - a home brew swap app

## THE PROBLEM

Many people like beer(and/or cider) and many people enjoy drinking beer together. Currently there is no service in Australia that links home brew makers with each other with the intention of sharing and swapping beers. There are online forums, etc, but there is no platform for users to post what drinks they've made and what they'd like to share, and no way for keen beer drinkers to search different areas for new beers to try. This app attempts to solve this problem.

Also, there are currently limited ways for homebrewers to get feedback on their drinks. Brewswap would also assist with this enabling users to seek and give honest feedback.  In the 2017 Australian Home Brewer Survey only 28% of the 2500 respondents have ever entered a home brewing competition - “Considering this is a fantastic way for home brewers to get feedback on their beers, this is surprisingly low.” (https://www.beercartel.com.au/blog/2017-australian-home-brewer-survey-results/)

## THE SOLUTION

Brewswap allows users to post the home-brew they are creating and share it with other people with similar interests. Users can search their local area and connect with different home brewers and share their drinks, ideas and tips. It would be free to search and view the site but a yearly membership fee is required for members that wish to connect or post their own. If a user would like to post their home-brew on the site it is free to do so. They can also receive messages but will require to be a paid member to reply to messages. 

Brewswap will provide a lot more opportunities for home brewers to share and get feedback on their drinks, while also trying out other drinks they might like and finding new recipes to try and tips for brewing. 

This will be done through an app in which the user logs in and then is able to search using postcode and distance an area in which they are able to visit. The number of brewers willing to share or swap drinks in the designated area will show up and the user is then able to send them a message. 

There will be no sale of home-brew through the site as it is not possible without a license.  
This would involve using all the gems we have learnt in the last couple of weeks. 

Additional features to add at a later date:
* Users could sell different home-brew related parts, items and ingredients which they no longer use, with 5% going to the website. This could be a popular addition - according to the 2017 Australian Home Brew Survey results - there are always new people getting into home brewing, and some people stopping, so it is possible that a marketplace for parts could be established.   

* Invite microbreweries to join up as users also, which helps them promote their brand.

## USER STORIES

The user stories were quite helpful in the design process, especially as I worked with a group (Cameo, Drew, Gen and me) to come up with all our user stories together. This made the process much more fun and also was a relatively quick process (once we got started).

## USER JOURNIES

Although the below looks confusing at first glance it does actually make sense if you start from the home page in the top left and follow the possible journies for the user. This was very helpfull when figuring out the models I would need to create the app successfully.

# WIREFRAMES/FIGMA

The design for this app was much more complicated than our previous project. Having numerous pages for different functions made it quite difficult. Choosing my colours and fonts wasn't too hard as I knew immediately that I wanted beer-like colours - browns/oranges - so it was easy putting those together in a way that I thought looked good. Some of my pages looked a bit plain so I added in some soft focus beer images to be the background (after trying a couple of other options). The most challenging part of the design was the profile page. I felt like I was trying to fit too much on the one page. It was hard to remember that the user can always scroll down to see more info and that I should use that space if needed.
